These files recreate SEM analyses from different Ecological papers and books using the lavaan package in R.

This is intended both as a learning tool for me, and for folk out there.

Note, I'll include the last version on which any analysis was tested.  If something about lavaan changes and it breaks an analysis, let me know, and I'll update it.
